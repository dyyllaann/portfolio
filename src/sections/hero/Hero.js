						Welcome! I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹ <br /> <br />I am a full stack (MERN)
						developer from Washington State.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						My first exposure to web development was teaching myself basic HTML
						at 12 years old to create websites for fun. Over the years, I
						continued developing my skills and applying them to more practical
						uses. Most my applications automate some facet of my life. For
						example, teaching myself Python in order to calculate matrices in my
						college Finite Mathematics course, or creating full stack apps to
						automate some of my workflow.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In 2021, I began learning data structures & algorithms and advanced
						web development with Python and MERN technologies via App Academy
						Open and The Odin Project.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Each of the projects I've decided to list here were created from
						scratch - no tutorials or walkthroughs here.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Coding truly is a passion of mine and I'm excited to share what I
						come up with next!
