          ### Hi there! I'm Dylan ðŸ‘‹  <br /> <br />
          My first exposure to web development was
          teaching myself basic HTML at 12 years old. Since then, I've created
          dozens of websites and apps that make my life easier. I had always
          considered programming a hobby and had never seriously pursued it. Now,
          20 years later, it's time to turn what I love doing into a career. 
          <br /><br />
          I am
          a graduate of Wenatchee Valley College, where I studied Math, Business
          Communication, and English. While attending, I was a recurring member of
          the Dean's List, an active member of the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society,
          and graduated with a 3.7 GPA. Although I had never taken a credited CS
          class in college, I began learning Python in my spare time so I could
          write apps that streamlined my mathemetics courses. 
          <br /><br />
          In 2019, I began
          work as a real estate broker. While working as a broker, I examined ways
          to apply my programming background to my day-to-day tasks. Most notably,
          this includes writing software that automates many of the repeatable
          processes of a running a real estate business, such as CRM, marketing,
          and transaction coordination. 
          <br /><br />
          In 2021, I began learning full-stack web
          development via The Odin Project. The Odin Project is a self-paced, free
          open source coding curriculum. As an experiential learner, The Odin
          Project has been immensely valuable in providing a path and building a
          portfolio. The majority of repos here are from The Odin Project's
          curriculum, while many of my personal apps are hosted privately. 
          <br /><br />
          At this
          stage (April 2022), I've developed two React apps, and I've begun
          learning backend with MongoDB and Express. 
          <br /><br />
          My main interests are
          automation, PropTech, and data. My dream job would be a development role
          at a PropTech or SaaS company that values creative, collaborative input,
          that employs my multidisciplinary background, and that makes a positive
          difference in people's lives.
